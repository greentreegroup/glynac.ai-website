                Employee response time directly affects collaboration, decision-making speed, and operational efficiency. Slow response times may indicate communication bottlenecks, disengagement, or workload overload. By tracking response rates, organizations can improve internal workflows, reduce delays, and foster a more agile and communicative work environment.

                Our system tracks periods of inactivity by segmenting time into 15-minute intervals over a 40-hour workweek, creating a total of 160-time blocks per week. By analyzing at least 26 weeks of data, we identify recurring low-activity periods and measure deviations from normal engagement levels. Recognizing patterns of inactivity helps businesses optimize meeting schedules, identify potential bottlenecks, and enhance productivity.

                Tracking inactivity patterns helps businesses identify disengagement, excessive downtime, or workload imbalances. Employees with frequent inactive periods may require additional tasks, better scheduling, or workflow adjustments. Recognizing these trends allows companies to redistribute work, improve resource allocation, and enhance team productivity.
